About a month ago, I gave a technical talk at The Flatiron School along with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zackshp" target="_blank">Zack Sheppard</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dsully360" target="_blank">Daniel Sullivan</a> about <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>. Stripe is a really powerful and simplified way to implement a payments infrastructure and checkout functionality into your application.<!--more--> 
In addition to it being easy to add payment forms through Stripe Checkout, it's also completely secure. They have fraud protection, PCI Service Provider Level 1 certification, and optional two-factor authentication. Even if someone does manage to hack into your application, you're never actually storing any of your customer's credit card information. I could go on and on, but that would probably ruin the whole point of showing you the video, right? Take a look below for our presentation on why Stripe is useful, and how we integrated it into <a href="https://github.com/cassidypignatello/laser-spirit">Laser Spirit</a> - a Rails engine we created as a simplified e-commerce platform to mount onto your host application, a la Shopify or Spree.
